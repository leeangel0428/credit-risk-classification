# Introduction

Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 20 aka the credit-risk-calculation challenge. For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 20's challenge on supervised learning. I am using a windows/PC laptop.

# Overview

Challenge: Use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

### Additional information

This challenge consists of three parts: 
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Create a logistic regresion model with the original data
- Write a credit risk analysis report

### Repository Structure
In this repository, you will find a credit_risk folder that contains a resources folder, the credit_risk_classification jupyter notebook, and the report. The resources folder contains the raw data from the lending_data.csv file. 

# Resources
Everything used was retained information gathered from my classes and class activities. As always shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.
